## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}

library(dplyr)
library(gtsummary)
library(huxtable)

tab <- 
  cars %>%
    tbl_summary(by="dist") %>%
    as_hux_table()
  
huxtable::font_size(tab) <- 6

tab

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
